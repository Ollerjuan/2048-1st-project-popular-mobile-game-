# 2048

The purpose of this game is to combine the same numbers in order to increase its value by using the up, down, left, right arrow keys. Once you have filled up the all the tiles slots and are no longer able to countiune swiping the game is over.
You will start off with 1 or 2 number values and swipe to connect similar numbers. Those number will then double and a new high number will have to be reach in order to double again.
