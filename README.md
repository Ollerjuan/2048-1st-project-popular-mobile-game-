# 2048 Project 1

# Your Chosen Game  

Purpose of the game is to combine the same number in order to increase its value. Once you have increased its value, my goal is to then create duplicate 
of the highest number in order to receive an even higher value to attain a higher personal score. 

# User Stories

- as a user, I want to be able to use the keyboard functions to swipe up, down, left or right to move the pieces
- as a user, I will need to add a function where if the numbers are combine they are doubled
- as a user, I will need to create scoreboard that doubles what score was swiped 
- as a user, I will like to end the game when no spaces are open

# MVP Goals

- as a user I would like to for everything to flow smoothly when sliding accross the board
- as a user I would like for the math portion to be correct everytime
- as a user I would like to  make my Start button be the reset button as well

# Stretch Goals

- I would like to design the game as pictured above if i have time


STEP 1

in order to combine numbers, a player chooses to either swipe up, down, left or right! This moves the entire board in the direction that the player chooses, creating new open spaces.

STEP 2 

Once the player has clicked START, they will start with two numbers and will recive random numbers one at a time, in which they will have to combine the same numbers togther to increase its value.
As more swipes are attain, more numbers will appear and less spaces will be open.

STEP 3

IF the player cannot increase the score and has no spaces left to swipe, the game is OVER!!
